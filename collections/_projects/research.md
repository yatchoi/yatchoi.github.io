During this phase of my tenure at Airbnb, I worked in a design + innovation studio led by co-founder Joe Gebbia.

While much of my work remains confidential, my research and contributions involved the application of Augmented Reality, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. I also helped facilitate user research sessions, gathering hands-on insights directly from potential users to shape innovative solutions.
