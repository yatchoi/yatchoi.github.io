Airbnb integrates with a variety of smart locks, enabling hosts to provide seamless, personalized check-ins for their guests.

This project emerged from our team’s research within Airbnb’s R&D innovation lab, where I rapidly built prototypes to prove feasibility and rally organizational support.

As the initiative matured, I led the development of the pin code management system, which generates codes for guests, syncs them with lock hardware, and manages their lifecycle throughout each reservation. I played a key role in research and partnering with lock vendors, shaping a flexible system that adapts to multiple vendor APIs, with the resilience to handle vendor-specific issues, device problems, last minute reservation changes and user errors. Our robust, adaptable system is recognized with a team-held patent.

Through the public launch and beyond, I ensured launch readiness, system stability, and swift issue resolution. Today, this integration has supported more than 500,000 Airbnb reservations and pin codes, with growth accelerating rapidly. This has lifted guest and host review scores while slashing customer support costs for Airbnb.
