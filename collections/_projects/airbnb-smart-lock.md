Airbnb integrates with a variety of smart locks for Hosts to be able to provide seamless and personalized check-in for their guests.

My involvement in this project started from the early R&D phases, rapidly building prototypes to demonstrate feasibility and garner organizational support. 

As the venture matured, I led the development of the pin code management system which generates codes for guests, synchronizes them with lock hardware, and manages the lifecycle throughout the reservation. I heavily contributed to the research and partnership with smart lock vendors, helping to design a generic system that adapts to a multitude of vendors. Our team holds a patent for this work.

Through public launch and beyond, I helped prepare the team for launch readiness, ensuring stability, and rapidly resolving issues. Today more than 500k Airbnb reservations, and pin codes, have been served through this integration, and rapidly growing.
