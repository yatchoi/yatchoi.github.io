In my early years at Airbnb, I helped build the core features hosts rely on daily to manage their spaces.

I developed listing management tools, third-party calendar syncing, and host email/notification systems. I created the initial data pipeline for identifying “Superhost” status, spotlighting top-performing hosts. I also played a major role in the “Instant Book” initiative, where within a year, we rolled out features that incentivized 80% of hosts worldwide to switch from request-to-book to instant one-click reservations — now Airbnb’s standard.
